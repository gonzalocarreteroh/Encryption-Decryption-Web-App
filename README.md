This is a personal project I am working on. I started this project because I wanted to combine the knowledge I have 
gained in my courses Applied Cryptography and Computer Networks, in order to solidify my understanding of both subjects 
and expand on some of the concepts.

* Developed a web application using Flask that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using passwords
* Created three routes handling GET and POST HTTP requests, rendering HTML files to enter the inputs and display the outputs
* Built an IND-CCA secure authenticated encryption scheme for encrypting and decrypting the messages using Python and the library cryptography
* Followed an encrypt-then-mac approach using AES-128 on CTR mode for encryption and HMAC for integrity (up to date standars of security)
* Additionally tested the HTTP requests using Postman

Tools used: Python, HTML, Flask, Postman
